# Project_Parallaxwebpage
This project is a simple parallax website that features multiple sections with background images and text. The parallax effect is achieved by setting the background images to scroll at a different speed than the content, creating a 3D-like effect as you scroll through the page.

Key Features:
Parallax Sections: There are three sections with fixed background images (pimg1, pimg2, pimg3) that move at a slower rate compared to the content, creating the parallax effect.
Text Overlays: Each parallax section includes text (ptext) that is centered vertically and horizontally, providing a visually appealing focal point.
Content Sections: The website includes light and dark sections (section-light, section-dark) for content like "About," "Front-End Developer," and "Contact Detail" information.
Responsive Design: The CSS includes media queries to adjust font sizes, padding, and background behavior for smaller screens, ensuring the website is accessible and visually consistent on various devices.
